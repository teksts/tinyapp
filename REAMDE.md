## Features
TinyApp provides a simple and straightforward interface for shortening links. Users can edit destination URLs assigned to aliases after links have been shortened, which can prove very useful for team work environments. If you're sharing resources that change often with a team, and find that it's a pain to make sure everyone is making use of the correct shortened URL as focus shifts from page to page, fear no more! With TinyApp, simply generate once, distribute that link, and edit its target as suits your needs.

To redirect, simply append the alias generated by TinyApp to the following url:
```
http://tinyapp.com/u/
```
E.g.
```
http://tinyapp.com/u/[abc123]
```


Redirection editing permissions are tied to your account, so while anyone with your shortened URLs can make use of them to reach corresponding web pages, no one but you can delete them or change their destination.

A simple visit tracker for each link allows users to monitor traffic through each link they have created, both for unique visitors and for total visits.
